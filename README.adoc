= Spring Authorization Server

The Spring Authorization Server project, led by the https://spring.io/projects/spring-security/[Spring Security] team, is focused on delivering https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-01#section-1.1[OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server] support to the Spring community.

This project replaces the Authorization Server support provided by https://spring.io/projects/spring-security-oauth/[Spring Security OAuth].

== Feature Planning
This project uses https://www.zenhub.com/[ZenHub] to prioritize the feature roadmap and help organize the project plan.
The project board can be accessed https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/authorization-server-5e8f3182b5e8f5841bfc4902/board?repos=248032165[here].
It is recommended to install the ZenHub https://www.zenhub.com/extension[browser extension] as it integrates natively within GitHub's user interface.

The completed and upcoming feature list can be viewed in the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-authorization-server/wiki/Feature-List[wiki].

== Support Policy
The Spring Authorization Server project provides software support and is documented in its link:SUPPORT_POLICY.adoc[support policy].

== Getting Started
The first place to start is to read the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-01[OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework] to gain an in-depth understanding on how to build an Authorization Server.
It is a critically important first step as the implementation must conform to the specification defined in the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework and the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-authorization-server/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Specifications[related specifications].

The second place to start is to become very familiar with the codebase in the following Spring Security modules:

- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/main/oauth2/oauth2-core[OAuth 2.0 Core]
- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/main/oauth2/oauth2-client[OAuth 2.0 Client]
- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/main/oauth2/oauth2-resource-server[OAuth 2.0 Resource Server]
- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/main/oauth2/oauth2-jose[OAuth 2.0 JOSE] (Javascript Object Signing and Encryption)

A significant amount of effort was put into developing the https://spring.io/blog/2018/01/30/next-generation-oauth-2-0-support-with-spring-security[Next Generation OAuth 2.0 Support in Spring Security].
The goal is to leverage all the knowledge learned thus far and apply the same to the development of Spring Authorization Server.

Submitted work via pull requests should follow the same coding style/conventions and adopt the same or similar design patterns that have been established in Spring Security's OAuth 2.0 support.

== Documentation
Be sure to read the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference[Spring Security Reference], as well as the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/index.html[OAuth 2.0 Reference], which describes the Client and Resource Server features available.

Extensive JavaDoc for the Spring Security code is also available in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/[Spring Security API Documentation].

== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of conduct].

== Downloading Artifacts
See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-Artifacts[downloading Spring artifacts] for Maven repository information.

== Building from Source
Spring Authorization Server uses a https://gradle.org[Gradle]-based build system.
In the instructions below, https://vimeo.com/34436402[`./gradlew`] is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as
a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build.

=== Prerequisites
https://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect[Git] and the https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads[JDK8 build].

Be sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the `jdk1.8.0` folder extracted from the JDK download.
