= Getting Started

If you are just getting started with Spring Authorization Server, the following sections walk you through creating your first application.

[[system-requirements]]
== System Requirements

Spring Authorization Server requires a Java 11 or higher Runtime Environment.

[[installing-spring-authorization-server]]
== Installing Spring Authorization Server

Spring Authorization Server can be used anywhere you already use https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/prerequisites.html[Spring Security].

The easiest way to begin using Spring Authorization Server is by creating a https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]-based application.
You can use https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io] to generate a basic project or use the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-authorization-server/tree/main/samples/default-authorizationserver[default authorization server sample] as a guide.
Then add Spring Authorization Server as a dependency, as in the following example:

[[maven-dependency]]
.Maven
[source,xml,role="primary",subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-authorization-server-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[[gradle-dependency]]
.Gradle
[source,gradle,role="secondary",subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
implementation "org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server:{spring-authorization-server-version}"
----

TIP: See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started.installing[Installing Spring Boot] for more information on using Spring Boot with Maven or Gradle.

[[developing-your-first-application]]
== Developing Your First Application

To get started, you need the minimum required components defined as a `@Bean` in a Spring `@Configuration`. These components can be defined as follows:

TIP: To skip the setup and run a working example, see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-authorization-server/tree/main/samples/default-authorizationserver[default authorization server sample].

[[sample.gettingStarted]]
include::code:SecurityConfig[]

This is a minimal configuration for getting started quickly. To understand what each component is used for, see the following descriptions:

<1> A Spring Security filter chain for the xref:protocol-endpoints.adoc[Protocol Endpoints].
<2> A Spring Security filter chain for https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/index.html[authentication].
<3> An instance of `UserDetailsService` for retrieving users to authenticate.
<4> An instance of xref:core-components.adoc#registered-client-repository[`RegisteredClientRepository`] for managing clients.
<5> An instance of `com.nimbusds.jose.jwk.source.JWKSource` for signing access tokens.
<6> An instance of `java.security.KeyPair` with keys generated on startup used to create the `JWKSource` above.
<7> An instance of `ProviderSettings` to configure Spring Authorization Server.
