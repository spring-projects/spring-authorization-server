= Messages Sample

This sample integrates `spring-security-oauth2-client` and `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server` with *Spring Authorization Server*.

The username is `user1` and the password is `password`.

== Run the Sample

* Run Authorization Server -> `./gradlew -b samples/default-authorizationserver/samples-default-authorizationserver.gradle bootRun`
** *IMPORTANT:* Make sure to modify your `/etc/hosts` file to avoid problems with session cookie overwrites between `messages-client` and `default-authorizationserver`. Simply add the entry `127.0.0.1	auth-server`
* Run Resource Server -> `./gradlew -b samples/messages-resource/samples-messages-resource.gradle bootRun`
* Run Client -> `./gradlew -b samples/messages-client/samples-messages-client.gradle bootRun`
* Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
* Log in with the credentials injected into the sample server via the DefaultSecurityCofnig.java.  E.g. "user1", "password"
