= OAuth 2.0 Integration Sample

This sample integrates `spring-security-oauth2-client` and `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server` with *Spring Authorization Server*.

== Run the Sample

* Run Authorization Server -> `./gradlew -b samples/boot/oauth2-integration/authorizationserver/spring-security-samples-boot-oauth2-integrated-authorizationserver.gradle bootRun`
** *IMPORTANT:* Make sure to modify your `/etc/hosts` file to avoid problems with session cookie overwrites between `client` and `authorizationserver`. Simply add the entry `127.0.0.1	auth-server`
* Run Resource Server -> `./gradlew -b samples/boot/oauth2-integration/resourceserver/spring-security-samples-boot-oauth2-integrated-resourceserver.gradle bootRun`
* Run Client -> `./gradlew -b samples/boot/oauth2-integration/client/spring-security-samples-boot-oauth2-integrated-client.gradle bootRun`
* Go to `http://localhost:8080`
